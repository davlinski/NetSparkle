## Description

Simple .net update checker & installer downloader. You provide, somewhere on the net, an rss xml file that advertises latest version. You also provide release notes. This library then checks for an update in the background, shows the user the release notes, and offers to download the new installer.

## About This Fork

This is a fork of NetSparkle, which has been forked by various people at various times. As of 2016-09-11, this is the "latest" fork. I, Deadpikle, am not actively working on or maintaining this repo outside of issues I experience using it for work, but I welcome any and all bug reports, pull requests, and other feature changes. In other words, I'm happy to help maintain the code so we don't have a million forks floating around. 

I highly recommend checking out https://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Windows, which is a more Chrome-like software updater. That repo is actively maintained. You could also check out WinSparkle at https://github.com/vslavik/winsparkle, but there isn't a merged .NET binding yet.

Some things TODO if you want to help:

- Delete the downloaded installer once we're done? (Perhaps using START /wait?)
- I'm pretty sure there's a bug where `SecurityMode.Strict` doesn't properly check the DSA on update files
- Better WPF support. WPF app updates work right now, but this project has obviously been created for Forms instead. There's already been work to keep the UI separate from the actual updater, which is good, but better WPF support/documentation/etc. would be helpful.
- Could we do something neat to tie this in with Squirrel.Windows? https://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Windows
- Clean up the code (this is needed quite a bit)
- Update the example files and demo project

## Basic Usage

    _sparkleApplicationUpdater = new Sparkle(
        @"http://example.com/appcast.xml", 
        this.Icon, 
        SecurityMode.Strict,
        @"<DSAKeyValue>...</DSAKeyValue>",
    );
	_sparkleApplicationUpdater.CheckOnFirstApplicationIdle();

On the first Application.Idle event, your appcast.xml will be read and compared to the currently running version. If it's newer, the user will be notified with a little "toast" box if enabled, otherwise with the update dialog containing your release notes (if defined). The user can then ignore the update, ask to be reminded later, or download it now.

If you want to add a manual update in the background, do

    _sparkleApplicationUpdater.CheckForUpdatesQuietly();

If you want have a menu item for the user to check for updates, use

    _sparkleApplicationUpdater.CheckForUpdatesAtUserRequest();

If you have files that need saving, subscribe to the AboutToExitForInstallerRun event:

    _sparkle.AboutToExitForInstallerRun += ((x, cancellable) =>
    {
    	// ask the user to save, whatever else is needed to close down gracefully   
    });  

## App Cast

[TODO -- this section]

By default, you need 2 DSA signatures (DSA Strict mode):

1. One in the enclosure section for your download file (sparkle:dsaSignature="...")
2. Another on your web server to secure the actual app cast file. **This file must be located at [CastURL].dsa** -- in other words, if your download URL for the app cast is http://someurl.com/awesome-software.xml, you need a valid DSA signature for that file stored at http://someurl.com/awesome-software.xml.dsa .

## Requirements

- .NET 4.5

## History
June 2016 Steffen Xonna: Forked the library to raise the security and change some handling for an better usability for the user.  

 - Introduce an SecurityMode
   - SecurityMode.Unsafe = Is nearly the same like before. If there isn't an Signature or an DSA Key the files will be accepted. If both is present the signature has to be valid. *i don't recommend this mode.* It has critical security issues.
   - SecurityMode.UseIfPossible = If an local DSA key is available then an signature is neccessary. If both is present the signature has to be valid.
   - SecurityMode.Strict = The default-mode. This mode enforce the avaibility of an local DSA Key. If none is available the updatefiles will be rejected. *I strongly recommend this mode.*
 - Added support for DSA public key as parameter for sparkle.
 - Added support for appcast sidecar file which contains the DSA signature. Depends on the same rules (SecurityMode) like all other files.
 - Added support for DSA signatures of release note links. Depends on the same rules (SecurityMode) like all other files.
 - Added support for embedded release note.
 - Added support for relativ downloads and relativ external release notes.
 - Added the possibility to show the form synchronized with the main form. I hope for better handling for the user. So no window in background or multiple windows will be shown.
 - Added better handling of ssl connections (all downloads should use the same code and not 3 different)
 - Added support for custom registry path of configuration
 - Fix: don't accept ssl connections with policy errors.
 - only show versions they match security mode (if signature is needed than only accept versions with signatures or without downloads)
 - Fix: download don't stop if download windows will be closed

23 December 2014 Bluewalk: Since the development seems very quiet, I have forked this project and started adding fixes from other forks into this fork. Also I started to add improvements to the library as well including:

 - Cleaning up the project files
 - Set proxy to use default credentials if available (jimgraham)
 - Prettied up the release notes overview
 - Fixed not showing the installed version and app name in the Softare Update window
 - Added option to make the toast optional
 - Added option to use the NetSparkle icon if wanted
 - Stopped using .NET 4 Client profile
 - Added options RelaunchAfterUpdate (which defines if the app needs to be relaunced after update) and CustomInstallerArguments which allows you to add arguments to the update command line (as per https://github.com/hatton/NetSparkle/commit/2dbaa197633b2624b765ff86b3a619501200580d)
 - Added support for Windows installer patches (MSP)

8 March 2013 John Hatton: Looking for something with a different approach, but found a good start in NetSparkle. Forked with these goals:

 - Reduce (maybe remove) the current "loop" background orientation. Most apps just want to check on launch.
 - Remove dependency on NLog, in fact just removed the whole separate diagnostic window. Now just uses Debug.Writeline().
 - Make UI use application icon based on a single icon input, rather than requiring a separate Image input
 - Make UI less obtrusive, fitting with apps that are updated frequent (like, daily)
 - Enable Markdown for release notes, in addition to the existing html
 - Made the application shutdown event cancellable

3 Jan 2012 Jim Graham: forked NetSparkle to GitHub because I had some requirements for a client program that weren't easily met by the standard version.

 - This version allows for a custom UI instead of the two Windows Forms dialog
 - Allows for one-time check for updates instead of running on a loop
 - Allows for custom configuration objects instead of reading/writing to the registry
 - Refactored the diagnostic to use [NLog] instead of a custom filestream
 - Refactored existing the application to fire an event for shutdown instead of `Environment.Exit`

October 2010 dei79 created SVN repository on [CodePlex]:

NetSparkle is an easy-to-use software update framework for .NET developers on Windows, MAC or Linux. It was inspired by the Sparkle (http://bit.ly/HWyJd) project for Cocoa developers and the WinSparkle (http://bit.ly/cj5kP5) project (a Win32 port).
